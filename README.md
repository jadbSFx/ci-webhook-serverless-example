# ci-webhook-serverless-example

This example uses the Node.js `serverless` toolset to create an AWS Lambda
function implemented in Python to handle websocket requests from a simulated
build system. Requests to the lambda function are logged to a DynamoDB database
so that the elapsed time of each step of the build process can be captured. The
lambda function reports `build started` and `build complete` events to Splunk
Infrastucture Monitoring along with metrics for the build and each step (
`build_system.build_time_ms` and `build_system.step_time_ms`, respectively)

A sample dashboard is provided illustrating usage of these metrics and
annotation via events.

## Deploying the example to AWS

1. Install `serverless` from [https://www.serverless.com/](https://www.serverless.com/). This
toolset is used to push lambda functions and supporting components as described
via the `serverless.yml` configuration.

  ```
  npm install -g serverless
  cd ci-webhook-handler
  npm init --yes
  npm install --save serverless-python-requirements
  ```

1. Review the info in `serverless.yml`. You can change the names of the
resources in `serverless.yml`, but you'll need to make corresponding changes
to the lambda function.

1. Create an AWS Credential for serverless to deploy

  There are several options for connecting. See : https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/

1. Package the necessary python libraries with the runtime. `serverless` uses
Docker to build a custom runtime by pulling the AWS runtime as a docker image
and including dependencies declared in `requirements.txt` into that image to
form a custom runtime. NOTE: THIS MAY TAKE A VERY LONG TIME THE FIRST RUN (if
it has to pull base images from AWS Docker repo and run `docker build`)

  ```
  serverless deploy
  ```

  When that is complete you should see the lambda URL denoted under `endpoints:`
  as the sole `POST` endpoint

1. The configuration in `serverless.yml` sets up a secret using AWS Secrets Manager to
store your Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring credentials. This secret is by default
named `SignalFx/Ingest`. You will need to edit that secret and set the secret
values for two keys `SignalFxRealm` and `SignalFxToken`.

1. At this point you should have a running lambda function which you can test
at the command line via (using the lambda URL which was returned from
the `serverless deploy` command):

  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "environment": "env01", "buildId": "abc321", "eventType": "start_build", "buildStep": "start", "status": "success" }' <lambda_url>
  ```
  (wait a few seconds)
  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "environment": "env01", "buildId": "abc321", "eventType": "build_step", "buildStep": "step1", "status": "success" }' <lambda_url>
  ```
  (wait a few seconds)
  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "environment": "env01", "buildId": "abc321", "eventType": "build_complete", "buildStep": "finito", "status": "success" }' <lambda_url>
  ```

1. You should now be able to log into Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring and
create a new chart showing metrics `build_system.build_time_ms` and
`build_system.step_time_ms`.

1. You can generate some fake data with:

  ```
  python3 generate-test-events.py <lambda_url> <environment>
  ```

1. You can import the custom dashboard `dashboard_Build System Demo.json`. You
should see metrics and events depicted in that dashboard.
